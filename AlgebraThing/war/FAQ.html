	<h2 class="question">Q: How do I perform an operation on an equation?</h2>
	<p class="answer">A: Once you've entered an equation you'll be presented with four operations: addition, subtraction, 
	multiplication, and division.  Select the symbol corresponding with the operation you would like to perform
	(this operation will be displayed on both sides of the equal sign along with an input text field).  Enter a 
	into the nearby text field (underlined in purple) and hit the enter key. AlgebraThing will display your work,
	and then you may click simplify to see the result of the operation. Repeat until you've isolated a variable.</p>
	
	<h2 class="question">Q: How do I undo a step in my work?</h2>
	<p class="answer">A: See those nifty arrows along side your work history? Clicking any one of those will take you
	all the way back to the corresponding step. Be careful, but don't be afraid to backtrack if you're on the wrong path.</p>
